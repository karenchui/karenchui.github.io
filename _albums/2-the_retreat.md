title: "The Retreat"
description: "In May 2015, I went to a Ayahuasca retreat in a forest situated along the Amazon river. This experience was one of the most enlightening of my life. The people who I connected with as a result of this experience continue to remain in my life now. The Shaman and helpers were spiritual guides to our journey throughout the ceremonies. This album is both a dedication to those who were part of my journey and an attempt to portray the significance of the week for those involved."
