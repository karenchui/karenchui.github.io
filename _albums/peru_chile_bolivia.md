description: "During my elective travels at the end of my fourth year as a medical student, I explored parts of South America. During my time I visited various local attractions, wandered the mountains and celebrated the Fiesta del Esp√≠ritu Santo in the Plaza De Armas in Cusco. This album is a collection of those travels and the people I met."
