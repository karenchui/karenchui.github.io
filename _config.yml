  Photographer, DJ and entrepreneur. Born in Canada but raised mainly in Hong Kong, currently studying in Birmingham. I have always found myself drawn to exploring the wonders that the visual and musical arts haveÂ to offer. This page is simply a portfolio of my work so that it doesn't remain hidden on a laptop drive somewhere.
